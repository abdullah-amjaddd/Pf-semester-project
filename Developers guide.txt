Developer Guide
Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the system's logic, structure, and functionality to help developers understand and extend the system.

Structure
Classes and Key Components

RestaurantManagementSystem Class:

Private members: users, menu, userCount, menuCount.
Public methods: authenticateUser, displayMenu, takeOrder.
Files and Data Handling

Code Walkthrough
User Authentication

Validates credentials from users.txt using authenticateUser.
Matches username and password to assign the correct role (Admin or Waitstaff).
Menu Management

Admins can view and update menu items, which are loaded from menu.txt.
Each menu item has three properties: name, price, and category.
Order Management

Waitstaff can place orders by selecting items from the menu.
Tax (10%) and discounts (5% for orders above $100) are calculated dynamically.
Error Handling

Missing files (users.txt, menu.txt) throw runtime exceptions.
Invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values for order count) are handled gracefully.
Extending the System
Add inventory management for menu items.
Implement saving order details to orders.txt.
Enhance security by encrypting users.txt data.
